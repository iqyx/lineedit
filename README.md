LineEdit - a basic command line editor
===========================================

Lineedit aims to be a lightweight command line editor usable over common stream interfaces (like sockets, serial ports, etc.). It was written to be used on an embedded platform and its features and code are optimized for embedded environments.

Main planned features are:

* ANSI escape sequence support (basic input parsing and output formatting)
* single-line editing capabilities (cursor keys, backspace, del)
* preparation for more complex shell implementations with autocompletion
* support for history recall
